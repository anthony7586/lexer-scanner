when running make sure that all files are in the same directory 
files include:

lexer.py
main.py 
comparisons.py

ouput.txt 
input_scode.txt


These above are the program files that will be doing the reading and analyzing of the text code file,
and they are also responsible for outputting to a given file.

It is important to have all of these in the same directpry as the program will not run wihout each one. 

The ouput file should be included in the directory but making your own blank text file and naming it output.txt is ok.

After comfirming the directory holds all files needed you must run "main.py".

If you put mian.py in a directpry called "lexer scanner" on you desktop, can run "main.py" by opening a terminal in the directory and 
typing in:

    (this assumes your specific user name on the computer you are using is antho)

    " python -u "c:\Users\antho\Desktop\lexer scanner\main.py" "













This program was made with the file input_scode.txt file in mind but can be modified to fit any langage and text file 
with slight modifications to the comparisons.py file Regular expresions.
It is important to know what regular expresions are when modifying it for any given language

Regular expresions: 
"A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it;
the functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a given regular expression"
